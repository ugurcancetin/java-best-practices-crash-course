## 1️⃣ Package by Layer (Traditional Approach)
This approach organizes code into technical layers:
- 📌 controller → Handles HTTP requests
- 📌 service → Business logic
- 📌 repository → Database access
- 📌 model → Entities / DTOs

2️⃣ Package by Feature (Better for Scalability)
Instead of separating by layer, this approach groups all related files into a feature package.

## 📊 Comparison Table

| **Aspect**         | **Package by Layer**  | **Package by Feature**  |
|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Structure**     | Organizes code by technical layers (e.g., `controller`, `service`, `repository`) | Groups all related files into a feature package (e.g., `order`, `product`) |
| **Example**       | `com.example.ecommerce.controller.OrderController` | `com.example.ecommerce.order.OrderController` |
| **Pros**         | - Clear separation of concerns <br> - Easy to onboard new developers | - Easier to scale <br> - Encourages modular development <br> - Easier for microservices |
| **Cons**         | - Hard to navigate in large projects <br> - Cross-layer changes require multiple edits | - Some code duplication <br> - Can feel unfamiliar to developers used to layered architectures |
| **Best for**     | Small to medium projects <br> Monolithic applications | Large-scale apps <br> Microservices architecture |
